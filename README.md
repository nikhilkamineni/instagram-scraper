## a healthier way to instagram
### https://zen-gram.herokuapp.com

## About

A simple web app that scrapes instagram using Cheerio.js. It allows you to keep track of various instagram accounts without having to sign up for an instagram account yourself.

## Motivation

Admittedly, this app was largely made for my own educational purposes. That said, it was inspired by the following ideas:

* Social media can be addictive and can be a huge distraction
* But cat (and dog!) pictures are awesome
* Giving your private info to a company that doesn't have the greatest track record of keeping your info private is... not ideal
* But looking at pictures of cats on synthesizers in space is the perfect way to kill a few minutes when you're taking a break from work

Surely there is a way to keep track of your favorite instagram accounts without having to signup for an account and getting sucked into the addictive nature of these things?

## Features

* Create a free account without handing over any private data
* Instagram account not required
* No infinite scrolling
* No embedded video
* No extraneous UI elements
* No advertising
* Ability to change your account password

## Development

PR's welcome!

### Setup

1. Fork/clone repo to a location of your choice

1. Run `npm install` in root folder

1. `cd` into the `client` folder and run `npm install`

1. Run `npm start` in root folder

1. In a new terminal window run `npm start` in the `client` folder

NOTE: If you have the `concurrently` npm package installed, you can just run `npm run dev` in the root folder to start up the server and client at the same time in a single terminal window.

### API Reference
